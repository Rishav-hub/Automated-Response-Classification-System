## Assignment 1
Here we have use Twitter Dataset. You can consider using any other dataset having 2 or more classes to classify.

## Assignment 2
Use GRU and encoder model to train on any dataset.

## Assignment 3
This project is been implemented with the help of Pytorch framework. Create the project which you have taken from the internship with the help of Tensorflow framework. Try to use different approaches to solve the problem to achieve better result and also create a proper document with explanation.

## Assignment 4
Upload your data to Azure blob storage and read the data from Azure blob storage instead of S3 bucket and change the data ingestion component accordingly. Try to optimise the code you have written for all the components. For example - Let's say, the data ingestion component takes 1 minute to complete. You need to optimise in such a way that the process can be completed in less than 1 minute, like in 45 seconds or 30 seconds.

## Assignment 5
AWS services lile S3 bucket was used to store the data and the model. Azure services like Azure App Service was used to deploy the application and github actions were used for CI/CD. You need to deploy your project on Google cloud platform and to save the model artifacts you have to use Azure blob storage. For CICD you have to use CircleCI.
